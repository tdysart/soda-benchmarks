# SODA-BENCHMARKS

This project contains scripts and code to benchmark SODA tools in different scenarios.


## How to Use?

We depend on Docker and a pre-built [Docker image](.devcontainer/Dockerfile#1)
which contains the binaries to run the benchmarks. We recommend using VS Code
Dev Containers to orchestrate the container setup and provide the correct
environment for running the examples and benchmarks.

To use Dev Containers, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install the Container Tools extension: Open Visual Studio Code and install the "Container Tools" extension from the Extensions view.
3. Open the folder in a Dev Container: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
4. Navigate to the relevant folder and check its README.md for instructions on executing the examples or benchmarks.


## What Next?

Start by navigating to the [examples](examples/) folder. Each example
includes a README.md with instructions on how to run it and details about the
generated artifacts.

For a step-by-step guide, see the [tutorials](tutorials/) folder. It
includes Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the full workflow, from PyTorch
models to Verilog and GDS generation using SODA and open-source tools.

If you want to create accelerator cores for your own models, check out the
[models](models/) folder. It contains Python scripts to download or
implement machine learning models, and scripts to transform these models or
parts of them into Verilog.

For a PyTorch-based PolyBench kernel suite, see the [benches](benches/)
folder, and for the `sb-cli` experiment scaffolding tool, see
[sb_cli](sb_cli/). Project-wide Python dependencies and tasks (tests, lint,
docs, `sb-cli`) are managed with [pixi](https://pixi.sh) via the root
[`pixi.toml`](pixi.toml) — run `pixi run <task>` from the repo root.

`pixi install` installs this repo editable, which is what makes `benches` and
`sb_cli` importable and puts the `sb-cli` command on `PATH` — inside the
environment you can call `sb-cli` directly as well as `pixi run sb-cli`. Both
work from any directory. List the available kernels with `pixi run sb-cli list`.

There is a second pixi environment, `sc`, which adds SiliconCompiler on top of
the default one. Nothing in the default environment needs it — `sb-cli` only
*generates* the `sc_flow.py` build script — so it is opt-in: `pixi install -e
sc`, then `pixi run -e sc <task>`. See
[docs/SiliconCompilerBackend.md](docs/SiliconCompilerBackend.md).

To scaffold and run a synthesis experiment for a PolyBenchPyTorch kernel:

```bash
pixi run sb-cli init \
    --benchmark_name PolyBenchPyTorch.linear_algebra.blas.gemm \
    --dataset MINI \
    --dtype float32 \
    --device nangate45 \
    --clock_period 5 \
    --flow baseline \
    --stage llvm \
    --output_dir gemm_mini_test

cd benches/experiments/gemm_mini_test
pixi run make
```

`--output_dir` is optional. When omitted, `init` names the experiment
`<benchmark>-<dataset>-<dtype>` (here, `gemm-MINI-float32`) and `fork` names it
after its source, both appending the first free `-000`, `-001`, ... counter if
that name is taken. That makes repeated runs safe to script — each one lands in
a fresh directory instead of failing on a name collision:

```bash
pixi run sb-cli init --benchmark_name gemm        # → gemm-MINI-float32
pixi run sb-cli fork --from gemm-MINI-float32     # → gemm-MINI-float32-000
pixi run sb-cli fork --from gemm-MINI-float32     # → gemm-MINI-float32-001
```

An explicitly passed `--output_dir` still fails on a collision, so nothing is
ever silently overwritten. Deriving a name for `init` requires
`--benchmark_name`; without it, pass `--output_dir`.
